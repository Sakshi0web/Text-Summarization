            <p class="dis"><br>
                Summarizing and paraphrasing are two techniques that can be used for different purposes.For example, 
                <br>you can summarize a piece of text if you want to make it a little shorter for your audience. On the other 
                <br>hand, you can paraphrase some content if you want to improve the flow and clarity.
                <br><br>
                Now, since these two are both the names of techniques <b>(and they are both used in writing)</b>, it can be  
                <br>a little confusing to know how exactly they’re different.
                <br><br>
                In this blog post, we will be looking at some of the main differences between these two. To make the 
                <br>whole concept clearer, we will also show some examples using sample text.
                <br><br>
                <b>What is Summarizing?</b> 
                    <br><br>
                    In the words of Merriam-Webster, the definition of summarizing is as follows:

                     <br><b>“…to tell in or reduce to a summary…”</b><br>
                    
                    Of course, this itself is not very descriptive. To understand the definition a bit better, we have to <br>understand what a summary is itself. And for that, the following answer is provided by Merriam-Webster:
                    <br>
                    <b>“…an abstract, abridgment, or compendium especially of a preceding discourse…”</b>
                    <br>
                    De-cluttering the complexity a little, we can understand a summary to be a shortened form of a piece of <br>content.
                    
                    The process of summarizing means shortening something in such a way that the main points are <br>encapsulated.    
                    <br><br><b>What are Some Uses of Summarizing?</b><br><br>
                    Summarizing is a useful skill that is required in different situations and instances. To name a few, here are<br> some uses of summarizing.
                    <br>
                    1. To create an excerpt or short summary for a blog post
                    <br> 2. To write an abstract of a research paper
                    <br> 3.To write a synopsis of an essay or an assignment
                    <br> 4.To create meta descriptions and other types of small-form content

                <b>What is Paraphrasing?</b>
                    <br><br> 
                    Paraphrasing is the act of rephrasing or restating a sentence, passage, or entire text while retaining the
                    <br> original meaning. It involves expressing the content in different words or sentence structures to convey 
                    <br> the same ideas or information in a clearer or more concise manner. Paraphrasing is commonly used to 
                    <br>avoid plagiarism, to simplify complex language, or to provide an alternative way of expressing a concept.
                    <br><br>
                    Effective paraphrasing requires a deep understanding of the original text's context and meaning. It's 
                    <br>important to accurately capture the essence of the content while using different vocabulary and 
                    <br>sentence structures. Paraphrased content should be coherent, grammatically correct, and faithful to 
                    <br>the source's intent.
                    <br><br>
                    Paraphrasing can be a valuable skill in various contexts, including academic writing, research, content 
                    <br>creation, and communication. It allows writers to present information in their own voice while maintaining 
                    <br>the integrity of the original ideas.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>What are Some Uses of Paraphrasing?</b><br><br>
                    Paraphrasing is a versatile and valuable skill that is used in a variety of contexts for different purposes. Here
                    <br> are some common uses of paraphrasing:<br>
                    1. Technical writers paraphrase complex technical information to make it more accessible to a broader <br>audience without sacrificing accuracy.
                    <br>2.  Paraphrasing can be employed in legal documents to simplify complex legal jargon while maintaining the <br>legal intent and meaning.
                    <br>3. Translators use paraphrasing to accurately convey the meaning of phrases or sentences from one language<br> to another.
                    <br>4.Paraphrasing is a tool for editors and proofreaders to improve sentence structure, coherence, and clarity in <br>written content.
