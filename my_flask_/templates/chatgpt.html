            <p>
                ChatGPT is the talk of the town nowadays. According to sources, ChatGPT garnered around 100<br>
                 million users in its first 60 days—nowadays, it stands at 13 million. So, what has caused ChatGPT’s<br> 
                 popularity? As the name suggests, it’s an AI bot that works on the GPT model.<br><br>

                 Albeit trained in a 2021 model, it can present information quite seamlessly, which is why many people<br>
                  have jumped on this train. But does that impact writers? The simple answer is yes, it does.<br><br>

                  Whether it impacts them positively or negatively depends entirely on the writer. That’s why, today, <br>
                  we’re looking at another key factor: assisting your writing with the help of ChatGPT.<br><br>

                  However, you can’t use it alone, and you’re going to need assistance from other tools, such as Editpad. <br>
                  So, let’s dive right in and understand how you can master the art of writing with ChatGPT and Editpad.<br><br>

                  <b>What is ChatGPT?</b><br><br>
                  ChatGPT is an online chatbot and language model trained by OpenAI in GPT-3.5 and GPT4 autoregressive <br>
                  language models. The purpose of this AI chatbot is to answer questions and queries asked by users—the<br>
                   same way how you’d use a search engine.<br><br>

                   However, that’s where the similarities between search engines and ChatGPT end, as it provides detailed <br>
                   information Besides that, it also works based on prompts, which allow users to:<br><br>

1.Generate specific texts based on prompts—such as poems, songs, etc.;<br>
2.Find exclusive data and statistics;<br>
3.And write creative, fiction, or any other sort of literature;<br><br>
Therefore, ChatGPT has become quite a popular tool to play around with and gather important information,<br> conduct research, etc.<br><br>

            <b>What is TextRundownBox?</b><br><br>
           <u> TextRundownBox</u> is an online toolkit that has an array of options for writers. From checking for grammatical<br>
            issues to finding plagiarism, <u> TextRundownBox</u> has an exclusive collection of
            tools aimed to help writers in<br> various writing procedures. For instance:<br><br>

            This includes the ability to paraphrase quickly with the help of the paraphrasing tool. <br><br>
    Then, you have the grammar checker, which allows you to correct spellings, add punctuations, <br>fix repeated words, etc.<br> <br>
    After that, you can use a plagiarism checker to scan your content for originality or duplicity.<br><br>

    While it’s mainly an online simple and rich text editor, Editpad also offers a text summarizer—besides all<br>
     the tools mentioned above. These factors make it an all-around toolkit for writers today.<br><br>

     <b>How Does ChatGPT Impact Your Writing?</b><br><br>
     ChatGPT can help you write from scratch, or it can help you find information that you need to write yourself. However, <br>
     the way it impacts your writing depends entirely on you. Because you can use ChatGPT in three main ways:<br><br>

    - Find answers that Google may not be answering for you;<br>
 - Generate ideas about blogs, websites, books, poems, stories, etc.;<br>
- Find stat-based and factual information to feature in your content. <br><br>
That’s why the impact of ChatGPT in writing relies solely on how a writer assumes to use it.
